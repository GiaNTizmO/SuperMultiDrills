Added: Motor mining speed bonuses (configurable per motor).
Added: More Ender IO drill heads.
Added: Sharpness drill upgrade.
Added: Chassis tooltips.
Added: Some Mekanism recipes. Mekanism support is still a bit lacking though.

Changed: Efficiency upgrade recipe.
Changed: Drill chassis now renders empty battery gauge.
Fixed: Config not containing energy cost config if Math.UseCustomEnergyExpression is false.
Fixed: Ore Dictionary support for some recipes.

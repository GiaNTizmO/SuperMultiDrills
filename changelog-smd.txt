Super Multi-Drills Changelog

1.4.2
Added: Mekanism recipes are back. They are probably different since I created them from scratch.
Added: Disassembly Kit. Craft with a drill to take it apart, getting back all components and upgrades. Some data may get lost, such as custom names, so keep that in mind. Don't forget that most parts can be replaced by simply crafting them with a drill!

1.4.1
Fixed: Drill upgrade Fortune and Silk Touch being applied together, and Fortune having max level of 1.
Fixed: Missing drill upgrade tooltips.
(1.10.2): New build for this Minecraft version fixes Area Miner not working.

1.4.0
Update to 1.9.4?
